Discord has recently added new and useful features such as message components,
application commands. They are currently working on very many other things like
`App Discovery`, `Text In Voice`, `Guild Role Subscription`. Not to be left out
on the activities they've been working on for an awfully long time, but when
we'll see them completely nobody knows exactly.

## Account Popouts

This is a bit of an experiment, but it will show your profile when you click on
your tag and you can edit your status there.

## Account Pronouns

This is also a minor experiment, but useful for a lot of people. It adds an
additional pronouns field. They decided to do this probably because a lot of
people were putting pronouns in about me.

## App Discovery

Due to the date shift on the demise of API v6 Discord is also moving App
Discovery which we probably won't see later this year. Of course Discord is
working on App Discovery, and by having it as an experiment I was able to see
what it looks like so far.

Discovery can be found in the server settings at the very bottom. Normally you
won't see it there, but in the next post I'll tell you how to try these things
out.

## Auto Mod

You obviously haven't heard of this one. Discord is working on a new Auto Mode
feature that could replace some auto moderation bots. I don't know why this
change is coming this late when a lot of bots have known this for a good 4
years.

## Command Permissions V2

You've all heard about this one. It has been announced many times at events, but
it's still just an experiment.

## Text In Voice

They are currently introducing the `Text in Voice` experiment, which is causing
_few_ problems for bots.

This experiment has been around for a long time, it's just that then the staff
locked it and couldn't continue to post to the rooms. My messages were written
in December 2021, but I can't post there at the moment because the
[Garlic Team](/gt) hasn't received this experiment yet.

### Problem with Text in Voice

---

Staff locks everything, because nobody likes to use things before they are
released, but in this case there is a bigger problem. The Text in Voice
experiment crashes bots and the very popular `discord.js` library is also
compromised.
