After a long time, I decided to make a simpler website inspired by
[WalshyDev](https://walshy.dev/). Instead of pure HTML I decided to use NextJS
and React.\
Once I started making the site in this framework, I was browsing the internet
and came across [Lume](https://lume.land).

### What is Lume?

---

Lume is a framework that is written in TypeScript for [Deno](https://deno.land)
instead of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)\
It is simple, elegant and supports many template engines.

### Why Lume instead of NextJS?

---

I chose [Lume](https://lume.land) because I wanted to try something new after a
long time and because of [Deno](https://deno.land). I think it's unnecessary to use
[React](https://reactjs.org/) only for such a simple page. [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework, and
such pages usually have a lot of other scripts after they are built that would
just overwhelm this page. [Deno](https://deno.land) is also much easier to set
up.

Reasons for using [Lume](https://lume.land):

- Very fast
- Simple
- Supports many template engines
- Heavily customizable

I will continue to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) and
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org) for larger projects, but [Lume](https://lume.land)
is brilliant!
