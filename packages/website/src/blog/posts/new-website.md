After a long time, I decided to make a simpler website inspired by [WalshyDev](https://walshy.dev/). Instead of pure HTML I decided to use NextJS and React.  
Once I started making the site in this framework, I was browsing the internet and came across [Lume](https://lume.land).  

## What is Lume?
___

Lume is a framework that is written in TypeScript for [Deno](https://deno.land) instead of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)  
It is simple, elegant and supports many template engines.
