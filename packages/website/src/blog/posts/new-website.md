After a long time, I decided to make a simpler website inspired by [WalshyDev](https://walshy.dev/). Instead of pure HTML I decided to use NextJS and React.  
Once I started making the site in this framework, I was browsing the internet and came across [Lume](https://lume.land).  

### What is Lume?
___

Lume is a framework that is written in TypeScript for [Deno](https://deno.land) instead of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)  
It is simple, elegant and supports many template engines.

### Why Lume instead of NextJS?
___

I chose Lume because I wanted to try something new after a long time. I chose Lume also because of Deno, because I think it's unnecessary to use React only for such a simple page. NextJS is a React framework, and such pages usually have a lot of other scripts after they are built that would just overwhelm this page. Deno is also much easier to set up.  
  
Reasons for using [Lume](https://lume.land):
- Very fast
- Simple
- Supports many template engines
- Heavily customizable
